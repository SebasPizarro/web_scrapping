>The House approved a symbolic measure that would affirm the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s investigation into the handling of case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

>The measure, included in a House rule that cleared in 212-208 vote, has no practical implications, as the Oversight panel is free to continue its probe without any further action on the floor. However, the House GOP leadership has been touting the investigation as a better alternative to Republican Rep. Thomas Massie’s controversial legislation that would compel the release of materials in the Epstein case in 30 days.

They're throwing around symbolic gestures that do nothing. This slow walking fools no one. The GOP is running interference and stalling for the predators.",1

1n7u4w0,nca4ic6,If I had a dime...,1
1n7u4w0,nca529l,"The thing is, Donald Trump always knows he's going down. He always *believes* he's going down, and he's been that way for most of his life. He doesn't know why he succeeds; hiis inexplicable twists of fortune are as much a mystery to him as they are to everyone else. 

He's literally the evil, Bizzaro-world version of Forrest Gump: a low-IQ individual simply stumblingunwittingly through all the many major geopolitical events of his time. He makes terrible decisions and continues to strikes outrageous fortune, over and over and over again, without ever actually understanding why. 

Bullets whiz by him, career-ending scandals ding off him daily. But what I want to really reiterate is that he is *always scared shitless*. Despite appearing invulnerable to us, he always acts like a desperate, scared-shitless man.

When he does consciously attempt to take action, it's always the stupidest possible move he could choose to make, which he makes BECAUSE he's the stupidest possible person in the public stage, and it simply works, not for any reason he or any of us understand, but because he's just this dim-witted, savage, evil human being surfing on the far tail-end of some universal bell curve of outrageous luck, unaware how he got there, or why he's there, and perpetually terrified it will suddenly crash and throw him off.

Just look at him bribing Stormy Daniels in 2010s. This is a perfect example of him doing a really fucking dumb thing because he categorically misunderstands the people who support him and the forces buoying him, and doing the worst possible thing in the stupidest possible way, and getting away with it for no other reason than extraordinary luck.

People seem to think that Trump is aware of, and luxuriates in, his apparently invincibility. But it's the exact opposite. He lives in perpetual fear and paranoia. 

If he truly grasped and embraced his apparent invulnerability, he wouldn't have tried to cover up the Stormy Daniels affair. After all, as is very clear, the knowledge of that affair would probably have INCREASED his standing with his MAGA base, or at the very least, they would have been indifferent to it. 

Instead, he spent six figures and exposed himself to criminal liability to try and ""kill' the story. 

Everything he does, everything he has done for a decade and longer, is the actions of a man far out of his depths, scared and floundering as he's surrounded by dangers he doesn't comprehend, and often spared from said dangers by twists of luck and fortune that he clearly doesn't understand and never believes will save him, yet always does.

Like, if you really, truly go back and just look at his improbable life, it's honestly a little hard to even condemn him for being the way he is. 

He may be one of the luckiest human beings on the planet. He has spoiled or ruined so many fortunes, only to simply be handed another one by outrageous, insane amounts of luck. 

Everything he consciously does is the worst thing anyone could do in that situation, and it just simply keeps working. In ways no one can predict, for reasons literally no one understands, least of all him, because he's a moron.",1

1n7klqn,nc8ei1d,"I will almost guarantee that having the tariffs overturned and refunded is exactly what the plan is. 

Cantor Fitzgerald that was once headed by Sec of Commerce Lutnick (a huge tariff pusher) and is now led by his two kids (Brandon Lutnick, is the chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald and his other son, Kyle Lutnick, is the executive vice chairman) has been buying tariff refund rights at  .20c - .30c on the dollar for months. This means that when the tariffs get refunded Lutnick and his sons earn 300-500% on their investment in just a few months. If they bought $100b in refunds for $20b, they pocket $80b. They would not be making this investment if they didn’t already know it was a sure thing, and since their dad is Commerce Secretary and he used to run the firm, they know it’s a sure thing. 

Then, when tariffs are repealed, Trump can blame the crazy leftist judges for crashing the economy he himself has already crashed. We may not be feeling totally desperate yet, but our fate is sealed, and this will be blamed squarely on tariffs getting repealed, just like he planned so he would have a finger to point at the same time as he and his cronies steal billions from the US Treasury (a.k.a.

1n7gdv8,nc77vc4,That should not be the news being reported. The horrific insanity is that 216 GOP representatives do not support  the bill to release the files.,3352

1n7gdv8,nc78itz,So the vast majority of Republicans support protecting pedophiles. Got it.,336
1n7gdv8,nc78hhn,"From the article:

>Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Nancy Mace have all come out in support of the discharge petition, while virtually everyone else in their party cowers in fear of angering the president further. Speaker Mike Johnson has continued to offer [distractions and outs](https://newrepublic.com/post/199885/mike-johnson-vote-epstein-files) to Republicans who don’t want to oppose Trump, even going so far as to declare recess early and offer a shadow vote to give GOPers cover and pretend they’re doing something about the Epstein files.

This paragraph does not describe American democracy. We are something ""other"" now, but not a democracy. When lawmakers need to be afraid of the president of the United States, we have ceased being a democracy. When the speaker of the house kowtows to an infamous rapist, offering to dismiss evidence of his possible wrongdoing (i.e., raping underage girls) and seeks to give lawmakers ""outs"" as a way to avoid punishment from the president of the United States, we are not living in a democracy.

King Donald raped women. He very probably also raped young children. He has a string of illegalities a mile and a half long. He's a known philanderer, cheat, thief, crook and abuser of women. And he doesn't try to hide it.

Yet the speaker of the house, Mike Johnson, who (believe me) has demons of his own, wants to make things comfortable for republican lawmakers so that they can avoid the messy ordeal of being in King Donald's bad graces.

Fuck the entire Republican Party. They're abetting a known criminal. For money. For prestige. For honor and fake medals. Fuck Mike Johnson. May Jesus Christ descend from the heavens and shit on his face. And lastly, fuck Donald J. Trump.",194

Outside of that the state is very rural and very red. You don’t even have to drive that far from those areas to see the most country areas that consistently vote Republican. And they have a death grip on those voters.

* Obama won nationally in the popular vote by significantly more than any presidential candidate has since 
* Unlike Georgia where Democrats won in 2020, they're also still in the process of bottoming out with rural voters in North Carolina (aka they do so badly with rural voters in Georgia it can't really get much worse, but that's not true in North Carolina), which counteracts their gains in other parts of the state

Chief Justice was the head of what was initially the least powerful branch of the federal government. It was (and is still, technically) the only branch dependent on the other branches. At the time, it was difficult work. John Jay had a relatively light workload and did a tremendous amount of other work for the federal government, largely at the behest of Washington, but in general the life of a Supreme Court justice was pretty miserable. They travelled the country, were underpaid, and had to sit for relatively low level cases for the most part. And even Chief Justice was not a particularly influential position. As Governor of New York, John Jay could gain much more fame/regard and the position had much greater potential to become President or otherwise move to a more powerful position.

That is to say, at the time, Governor of New York would have been considered a greater role than Chief Justice. 

Same pretty much for Vice President - at the time of Calhoun, Vice President was not a springboard to the presidency, but was instead a position of little regard or power. This was in the process of changing around that time, but it wasn’t until the 20th century even that the VP became a position of note. So again, Senator would have actually been the more influential, “greater,” position.

Edit to add: there’s more to Calhoun’s decision to leave the Vice Presidency as well, but I decided to just focus on how the influence of the position has changed.",39

1mz6m1w,nahokqi,"We're still pretty far off from the primaries and a lot is going to change to the point where I'm somewhat reluctant to make any firm predictions. In 2005 people weren't talking about a massive recession, in 2013 almost no one seriously thought Trump would run let alone win or that immigration would be a central focus of the campaign, in 2017 no one was talking about a pandemic.

Any predictions we make have a very high liklihood of being wrong. With that caveat I do think that Trump will still be a dominant figure in 2028. If Donald Trump himself cannot run then I think one of his kids will run for president and will have considerable support in the Republican primary. As long as Republican voters keep nominating Trumps then the Trump family will not stop running for president. To see the GOP move on from Trump we will need to see a Trump run for the primary and lose to another Republican. 

For the Dems there's a lot of anti establishment energy. The Democratic primary voters are pissed at their own party for losing the presidency, house and senate in 2024 especially when the stakes were so high. They're also upset at what they see as a lack of fight and effort from the Dems. Whether this criticism is deserved or not is irrelevant. For Dems the overall most important issue is likely going to be electability/beating the GOP. Whoever can convince the Democratic voters they have the best odds will win the primary. This means Dems probably won't nominate someone too far left but if centrist Dems don't adequately show enough ""fight"" and reason to be trusted again it does open the door for a more leftwing candidate.",23

1mzt9qg,naoma09,"Boycotting Democratic candidates for their stance on Gaza and handing the win to Republican candidates who are even worse regarding this and all other matters is not exactly a great idea. I really don't get why non-revolutionary leftists are still pushing that rhetoric. They clearly don't understand the rules of the great game they are forced to be a part of, whether they like it or not.

Primary challenges like Zohran Mamdani in NYC are a possible avenue, but you need candidates to step up for that. How is it that Hakeem Jeffries gets to hold his safe seat completely unopposed since 2013? Something is clearly wrong there.

I don't think a lot is going to change though. As you've correctly pointed out, Israel is a geopolitical partner of the US. On the opposing side, Hamas and Hezbollah are geopolitical partners of Iran. From a coldhearted geostrategic view, the US have no reason to do anything about this genocide because their position in the region actually stands to benefit from Palestine getting wiped off the map. Wouldn't be the first time that millions of people died in the Middle East for the benefit of the US...

I think it's awful, but that is how the world works. War is the norm, peace the precious exception.",33

There's doctors and nurses there and everything is state of the art. Basically it's there for when a kid gets really sick that they have to be there their family can at least have some semblance of normalcy. 

On this particular day I learned that one of the family staying there that day were from out of state. They had come to Disneyland with their immunocompromised children. The way those kids live is by not getting sick due to the fact that everyone else is vaccinated and they have a less likely chance of getting sick. Unfortunately around this time morons and Orange county stopped vaccinating their kids for things like polio rubella and the like. Those poor kids never had a chance. They got the measles, which should have been preventable, and now they're stuck at the children's hospital just because some parents going to be bothered to vaccinate their children.

None of these goals are compatible, and among them tariffs are perhaps the worst as they allow the executive alone to pick winners and losers in our economy as companies like Apple need to seek out exemptions from him.  Crony capitalism on steroids and a whole new era of lobbying.

The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with Government employee organizations. The employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters.

>Particularly, I want to emphasize my conviction that militant tactics have no place in the functions of any organization of Government employees. Upon employees in the Federal service rests the obligation to serve the whole people, whose interests and welfare require orderliness and continuity in the conduct of Government activities. This obligation is paramount. Since their own services have to do with the functioning of the Government, a strike of public employees manifests nothing less than an intent on their part to prevent or obstruct the operations of Government until their demands are satisfied. Such action, looking toward the paralysis of Government by those who have sworn to support it, is unthinkable and intolerable.",2

1n3hej9,nbk2edv,"I don't understand.  What you suggest on your website might fuck with the Republicans but it would also only help them guarantee a win in the general election.  Democrats have already done this with several elections.  Not so much with cross-registration for the primaries but by targeted advertising in the GOP primaries.  *But Democrats actually support the more radical Republican in the primary.  And they do this in purple regions.*  This causes the more extreme candidate to lose the general election against a Democrat.

But what you suggest is the opposite.  You're saying you would help defeat more extreme candidates in the GOP primary.  That just all the more guarantees a Republican will win the general election.  

I think fucking with elections by actually cross registering with the opposition party is really risky and has drawbacks.  For one thing, you need a lot of people to do it.  And you need them to all act with the same playbook.  You already noted confusion in your description: are we boosting more extreme candidates or more radical candidates?   It's all for naught if the people participating can't even agree on a strategy.

The other thing is that you are effectively asking people to give up their vote in their own primary.  I thought about registering Republican in the 2016 primary.  I am in blue state and was hoping another Republican might win some delegates over Trump in our state.  But I ended up not doing it because a) I was genuinely interested in my Democratic primary (including important downstream/local elections) and b) cross registering to oppose Trump would have meant voting for Ted Cruz (barf).  

Also the people who help draw up these partisan maps aren't idiots.  If something is fucked with the party registration data, they will find other reliable proxies for which to draw up districts.",4

Many people who serve lean “right” politically. This doesn’t mean they are ready to do Donald Trump’s bidding, no matter what he asks of them. 

Many in uniform become apolitical while serving. I know I basically went dormant when it came to politics. I voted, but that was it. My oath was to the Constitution, and civilian control of the military was drilled into my brain. I would say that is not universal, but also not at all uncommon. 

I retired during Trump’s first term. Many officers HATED Trump with a passion. He makes a mockery of the values military professionals hold dear. 

Trump made me into a Liberal lol. That’s how much I hate him and his MAGA hordes.
